# tellervo

Tellervo is a desktop application for measuring, curating, and analysing dendrochronological samples. It works in conjunction with Tellervo Server, which stores all the data and descriptive metadata about your samples in a relational database. The architecture of Tellevo means that it is easy for different users within a lab to store their data together and to work collaboratively. With the right login details users can access their Tellervo Server from across the Internet. It is therefore possible to share data and collaborate with users from other laboratories too.
