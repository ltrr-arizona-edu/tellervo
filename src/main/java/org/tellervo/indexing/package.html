Algorithms for indexing (de-trending) data.

<p>These algorithms are easily runnable as Threads (they implement
Runnable), but most samples are probably too short and most computers
too fast for this to be really necessary.  They also are Graphable, so
the user can visually compare indexes.</p>



<h2>How to use in an application</h2>

<p>A single Index is straightforward to use:

<pre>
Index i = new Floating(mySample);		// create the index
System.out.println("Running index:" + i);	// print the name
i.run();					// run the computation
System.out.println("chi^2 = " + i.getChi2());	// print chi^2 value
i.apply();					// apply to mySample
</pre>

Because Indexes are Graphable, an application will usually give the
user the option to view the graph after running it, but before
applying it.</p>

<p>Since they're Runnable, you can also run it in a separate thread:

<pre>
Thread t = new Thread(new Exponential(mySample));
t.start();
</pre>

But this probably isn't necessary, unless you're on a slow computer or
want the interface to be highly responsive.</p>

<p>Usually, the user will want to see many different possible indexes,
and choose one.  For this, IndexSet is provided.  It will run a group
of common indexes.  The application can then display them all (in a
table, for example):

<pre>
IndexSet is = new IndexSet(mySample);	// create an IndexSet
is.run();				// IndexSet is also Runnable
for (int i=0; i&lt;is.indexes.size(); i++) {	// print each, along with chi^2
    Index x = (Index) is.indexes.get(i);
    System.out.println(x + ", chi^2 = " + x.getChi2());
}
</pre>
</p>



<h2>How to add a new indexing algorithm</h2>

To create a new indexing algorithm, just subclass Index.  There are
only 3 methods you need to deal with:

<ul>

  <li>Constructor.  It does whatever you want it to do.  You should
      call super(s) first.</li>

  <li><code>getName()</code>.  One version is already provided: it
      returns the name of the class.  If this isn't good enough for
      you (the Polynomial index does some nice formatting of its
      name), overload this method with whatever you like.  It should
      return the type of cross, but not include the name of the sample
      being indexed.</li>

  <li><code>run()</code>.  Again, whatever you want, but it has to
      fill the data field with the proper number of elements.</li>

</ul>

<p>To use it, you'll probably want to add it to IndexSet.</p>

<p>Be sure to write Javadoc for the Index, including what the
algorithm is and where it came from, and update the IndexSet Javadoc,
if you add it there.</p>
