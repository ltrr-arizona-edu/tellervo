User preferences.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Preferences are a (key -&gt; value) hash table.  Keys and values are both
Strings.  (This hash table is similar to, but independent from, the Properties
object behind the System.getProperty() / System.setProperty() methods.)</p>

<p>Unlike System's properties, not every standard key needs to be in the hash
table.  If a key isn't in the hash table, that means a default value should be
used.</p>

<h3>Naming Conventions</h3>

<p>Keys are named similarly to Java package names: as a chain of words,
from general to specific, separated by dots.  All Corina preferences start with "corina".
The second word is the subsystem (like "cross"), and the third word is what
attribute in that subsystem.  For example, the last folder
that the browser viewed is called <code>corina.browser.folder</code>.</p>

<p>While also not required, many also use the same terms for consistency,
like "foreground", "background", and "font".  For example, the key
corina.graph.background is the graph's background color, and
corina.edit.background is the background color to use in the editor.</p>

<h3>Default Values</h3>

WRITEME!
<pre>
-- defaults (pass with get()?  getPref("corina.grid", "true")??
	-- returning null is generally bad!
        -- better: PrefNotSetException.  why?
        
        try {
            Color c = Prefs.getColor("corina.foo.background");
            foo.setBackground(c);
        } catch (PrefNotSetException pnse) {
            // do nothing
        }
</pre>

<h3>Types</h3>

<p>All of the values are stored as Strings, but that doesn't mean they're completely
without structure.  Several types are used repeatedly, and in the same form:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Colors are stored as 6-digit hex strings, preceded by a '#' character.
        The strings are RRGGBB components, so "#000000" is black, "#ff0000"
        is red, and "#ffffff" is white.
        
    <li>Booleans are stored as the string "true" or the string "false".  (Any
        value not equal to "true" is considered false.)
        
    <li>Numbers are stored as human-readable strings, like "17" or "3.45".
    
    <li>Fonts are stored in ??? format.  For example, "Dialog 12" or "Times 18 bold".
        ???
        
</ul>

WRITEME: -- window geometries?  table column sizes?

<p>To make it easier to deal with storing objects as preferences, there are
some convenience methods which are simple wrappers around getPref() and setPref():
getFont()/setFont(), getColor()/setColor(), getBool()/setBool(), getFloat()/setFloat(),
and getInt()/setInt().  If a get method is asked for a type, and the String value
doesn't look like that type (for example, if getColor() is used to read a pref
which has value "7"), the method acts as if that preference isn't set.</p>

<h3>How it's Stored</h3>
WRITEME -- how it's stored (as a properties file, in ~/.corina or ...)

<hr />

<h2>Public Interface</h2>

<h3>Getting and Setting</h3>

<p>To get, set, or unset a preference, use

<pre>
Prefs.getPref(key);
Prefs.setPref(key, value);
Prefs.unsetPref(key);
</pre>

<p>You never need to do anything special to "save" the preferences.
When you set a preference, it automatically saves it to disk.
(You never need to do anything special to "load" the preferences,
either.  When you start Corina, they'll be loaded when they're needed.)</p>

<h3>Prefs Dialog: Letting the User Change Them</h3>

<p>To present the preferences dialog to the user, call

<pre>
PrefsDialog.showPrefsDialog();
</pre>

(Only one prefs dialog will ever be visible at a time;
if this is called twice, the original dialog is shown.)</p>

<p>Normally this should only be done
in response to the "Preferences..." menuitem.  But it can also be
called from a button or context menu, if being able to access
a prefs panel quickly would be helpful.  For example, a context
menu on the data of a crossdate might offer "Crossdate Preferences...",
which would lead directly to the crossdating preferences panel.
To open a specific panel, pass the name of a prefs panel to
showPrefsDialog(), like

<pre>
PrefsDialog.showPrefsDialog("CrossdatePrefsPanel");
</pre>

</p>

<p>Note that you can set preferences apart from the PrefsDialog.
For example, if you want to store the position of a window for
perceived stability, you can go ahead and do that with Prefs.setPref().
But there wouldn't be a corresponding entry in the prefs dialog for this.</p>

<h3>Listeners: Watching for Preferences Changes</h3>

<p>If you use preferences, you should also be aware of when they change.
When the user changes some preferences, your objects should update themselves
to reflect the changes.  For this, use a PrefsListener.  It's an interface
with just one method: prefChanged(PrefEvent).  Each time a preference is
changed, the prefChanged() method is called on each registered listener.
Use Prefs.addPrefListener() and Prefs.removePrefListener() to register
listeners.  (The PrefEvent object simply contains the key of the preference
which was changed.)</p>

<hr />

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

<p>You only need to read this section if you plan to add or modify
preference panes.</p>

<h3>Preferences File</h3>

<p>The preferences file is saved in a platform-dependent place which
is meant to be discoverable.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" align="center">
    <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>File Location</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mac OS</td>
        <td>"Corina Preferences" in the users' "Library" folder</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Windows</td>
        <td>"Corina Preferences" in the users' home folder</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Linux</td>
        <td>".corina" in the users' home folder</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The preferences file is currently a properties file, so whatever the
API for java.util.Properties says is valid.  I think it uses the native
encoding, not UTF-8, so be careful.  This, of course, may change in a
future version; I may switch to XML.</p>

<h3>The Components</h3>

WRITEME
-- each type of widget (ColorPrefsComponent, FontPrefsComponent, etc.)

<h3>The Panels</h3>

WRITEME
-- each panel (AppearancePrefsPanel, CrossdatingPrefsPanel, etc.)

<p>If you create a new pref panel, simply add it to PrefsDialog.java.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Standard Preferences</h2>

<p>These are all of the preferences which are handled by the PrefsDialog.
This list is not exhaustive: others may be used by specific subsystems.</p>

<h2>Why a Custom Preferences Package?</h2>

<p>This package is admittedly very similar to Java 1.4's
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/prefs/package-summary.html">java.util.prefs</a>.
The basic differences are:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" align="center">
    <tr>
        <th width="50%">corina.prefs</th>
        <th width="50%">java.util.prefs</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Storage to file only</td>
        <td>Storage to any backing (file, RDBMS, registry, etc.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Stores preferences</td>
        <td>Stores "user" and "system" preferences</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Prefs for Corina only</td>
        <td>Stores prefs in any number of "nodes"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Includes Swing dialog for modifying preferences</td>
        <td>Storage only</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<ul>
    <li>storage to a file only
    <li>no "system" preferences
    <li>storage for a single "node" only
    <li>a really nifty Swing dialog for modifying Corina-specific preferences
</ul>

<p>With the exception of the last one, there's no reason java.util.prefs couldn't
replace this package in the future.  The reason I'm avoiding java.util.prefs for
now are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It requires Java 1.4, and Java 1.4 is still fairly new
    <li>It's not clear (to me) where it stores user preferences; my primary
        clients are running Windows with Netware 4, which doesn't set users'
        homes correctly, so it would fail if it used, for example, the
        Windows "registry".  My implementation requires nothing more than
        the Java property user.home to be set correctly.
</ul>

<p>And, strange as it is for me to quote
<a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> (since I strongly
agree with half of what he says and strongly disagree with the other half),
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000026.html">"for
your most important, mission critical stuff, you have to use a tool
that is one level lower in abstraction than ideal."</a>  Also, note
that Knuth's groundbreaking program T<sub>E</sub>X uses integers (with
custom floating-point functions) to do floating-point arithmetic.
It works identically everywhere, and is probably also perhaps the only
non-trivial bug-free program in existence.</p>
