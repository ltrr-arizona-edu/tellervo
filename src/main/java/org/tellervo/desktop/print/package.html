A high-level interface for printing.

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>Java's printing API works like this: you provide a class which
implements Printable which defines how to print a page, using
primitive graphics drawing commands, like drawLine() and drawString().
It provides these descriptions for each page you want to print,
possibly more than once.</p>

<p>That was probably easiest for the people writing Java to implement.
Unfortunately, it's not the way any real program actually works.
(This problem, of course, was solved 20 years ago, by Knuth with
T<sub>E</sub>X.  What they should have done was simply put a small
T<sub>E</sub>X engine - heck, even roff - in the Java class libraries,
and given a high-level wrapper for it.  Programmers, especially Java
programmers, though, seem particularly fond of re-inventing the wheel
themselves.)</p>

<p>In reality, a program will want to print a document, usually
consisting of mostly text.  The program won't really care how many
pages it ends up being, or where the page breaks occur.  So I've built
a higher-layer interface on top of Java printing for this sort of use.
(An added benefit is that if I ever want to port Corina to a better
programming language, I'll have a better interface than Java's
printing API to port.)</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Here's how it works: for an object you wish to print, write an
extension to the Printer class.  Sample is printed by SamplePrinter,
for example.  The constructor for this class will simply add Lines to
a List describing how to print out that document on paper.  A Line is
just a slice of stuff which knows how tall it is, and how to draw
itself.  Page breaks may occur only between lines.  Some Lines are
available for free: TextLine is a line of text, and EmptyLine is a
blank space, for example.  Or you can define your own, which isn't
very difficult.</p>

<table align="center" border="0" width="50%" background="white" style="border: solid 1px black">
  <tr><td><p style="border: dashed gray 1px">A line of text</p></td></tr>
  <tr><td><p style="border: dashed gray 1px">A second line</p></td></tr>
  <tr><td><p style="border: dashed gray 1px">&nbsp;</p></td></tr>
  <tr><td><p style="border: dashed gray 1px">Another line (below an EmptyLine)</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p>(Note that TextLines, unlike lines in HTML or T<sub>E</sub>X, don't
provide any line-wrapping support.  If your line is too long, it'll go
right off the edge of the page.  If you want to print a paragraph of
text, you'll have to write your own class which takes a long string as
input, and splits it into Lines using a line-breaking algorithm.  Such
a class wouldn't necessarily be hard to write, but Corina hasn't had
any need for one yet.)</p>

<p>When you're done with that, just print the SamplePrinter.  Printer
implements Printable (it may someday be switched to Pageable, so users
can see how many pages it'll be printing), so you can just print that
object.</p>

<!-- if i'm feeling up to it: i've created a nice abstraction for
printing documents consisting of lines of text, like tables.  can i
make another one that's good for printing generic square-celled
documents? - well, that's not very useful; it works for grids, and
probably nothing else.  but what would be useful is knowing how to
print something of arbitrary size, and have a corina.print class that
either (1) scales it down to fit on a page, or (2) tiles it on as many
pages as needed - that would be a powerful abstraction.  -->
