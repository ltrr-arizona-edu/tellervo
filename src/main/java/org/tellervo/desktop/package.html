<p>Years, Samples, and supporting classes.</p>

<p>Note: this package, and each sub-package, has a class "UnitTests"
which does unit testing of that package, using <a
href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>.  If you need to write new unit
tests, or add a new package, use this convention.  They don't show up
here, because they're not public classes.)</p>



<h2>Event model</h2>

<p>The event model consists of 3 classes: SampleEvent, SampleListener,
and SampleAdapter.  Currently, it only deals with
<code>Sample</code>s, as those are the basic data type of Corina, but
if necessary it can easily be extended to other types (for example,
Grids).</p>

<p>Using the event model is simple:</p>

<ol>

    <li>If you're displaying a view of a Sample, implement
        <code>SampleListener</code> so you'll know when it changes.</li>

    <li>If you change a Sample, call one of its <code>fire</code>
        methods so all the listeners will know to update their views.</li>

</ol>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>One last detail: <code>SampleListener</code> is the interface
to implement.  If you're not extending another class, though, you
can extend <code>SampleAdapter</code>, which is just a listener
with all empty methods.</p>

<p>Currently, the events are:</p>

<ul>

    <li><code>sampleRedated</code>, which means the starting/ending
        dates have changed</li>

    <li><code>sampleDataChanged</code>, which means that one or more
        of the numbers of the dataset have changed</li>

    <li><code>sampleMetadataChanged</code>, which means that one or
        more of the metadata fields has been changed (the element
        changed, or a key was added or removed)</li>

</ul>
