<p>Data sources for Corina.</p>

<p>A data source has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a name (user-settable) and icon
  <li>a way to list its contents, as Folders and SampleRefs
  <li>a right-click context menu
  <li>a get-info panel
  <li>a way to serialize itself, and deserialize itself, for storing in the user's prefs
  <li>a way to accept drops, allow drags of itself and its elements (optional)
  <li>create/delete, move/copy, rename, load/save, make-folder/list-folder (i.e., everything a filesystem does)
</ul>

<p>One trickiness is that some sources will need their own mini-browsers.  For example,
a favorites list is just a list of samples - nothing else required.  But a folder source
needs some widgets above the normal browser to choose which folder to browse.</p>

<p>The first version of Corina to support sources will support:</p>
<ul>
  <li>folder sources
  <li>favorite-list sources
</ul>

<p>Eventually, support will be added for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>recently-opened files
  <li>smart lists
  <li>a trash can
  <li>FTP sources
  <li>Rendezvous sources
  <li>RDBMS sources (JDBC)
</ul>
<p>(in approximately that order)</p>

<hr />

some old ideas:

<pre>
see Source.java -- that's the outline
for this package.

if sources DON'T have sub-sources,
i'll need a "SourcesList" object
which lists the sources, adds/removes
them, de/serializes them, etc.

-- refer to all samples by urls?
file:///...
ftp://...
recent://...
trash://
bookmarks://Masters/GOR10K.SUM
smart://Oak\ Masters/
jdbc:///...??
this makes some things really easy...

;ELEMENTS
file://Library/AYA/AYA100.REC
...
(easy to move datasets between computers,
then, right?)

or run a crossdate with
   file://Library/AYA/AYA100.REC
and
   ftp://ITRDB/.../TURK001.CRN
</pre>
