File formats for loading and saving dendro data files.

<hr/>

I really need to rework the filesystem layer.  Here's one idea I had:

<h2>Layer 1</h2>

(This layer is done.)

<pre>
- interface filetype just defines load(reader), save(writer), perhaps getDefaultExtension()
- (this makes the file parsing part of it really easy to debug and extend)
- new interface:

public interface Filetype {
       Sample load(Reader r) throws IOException;
       void save(Sample s, Writer w) throws IOException;
       // toString(), of course
       String getDefaultExtension(); // "
}

- always use buffered readers/writers, so i get readline/newline for free

- one filetype object may be re-used
- (the upshot of this is that i'll just create one of each and use that for everything)

- classes: Corina, HTML, Heidelberg, Hohenheim, PackedTucson, RangesOnly, Spreadsheet, TRML, TSAPMatrix, Tucson, TwoColumn

- they'll probably want to share some code.  so either make a common class (make Filetype an abstract class?) with some useful methods, or make a class with some static util methods.

- public interface: pretty much none.  no other subpackages will ever touch this.
</pre>

<h2>Layer 2</h2>

<pre>
- a fairly simple layer on top of that (1 class?) to load/save samples, given a filename.
- in GoF/DP terms, this is basically a facade
- takes care of:
  - buffering
  - creating a reader/writer from filenames
  - sync, so sample can't be changed during load()/save(), can't screw up a file on disk, etc.
  - ...
- (put FTP in this layer, too?)
- (put JDBC in this layer, too?)

- public interface: Files.load(filename), Files.save(sample) -- + URLs, JDBC, ...?
</pre>

<h2>Layer 3</h2>

<pre>
- an "intelligent" layer on top of this - ?
- handles caching, summary files, ...

- public interface: Files.getMeta(sample, field), Files.setMeta() ...?
</pre>

<h2>Left to do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clean up I/O...
  <li>fix summary.update() so it updates, not just creates
  <li>integrate it into browser
  <li>(add gzip to all files?)  (easy later)
</ul>

<h2>Packed Files</h2>

<p>unfortunately, some programs like to make what i call "packed" files,
or files with several datasets.  since the tucson format needed the id
number on each line, you didn't lose anything by just catting together
all your files.</p>

<p>that's not what a "file" is, though.  a file is a document.</p>

<p>currently, i only let you "pack" and "unpack" normal files into packed
files as a special function of the browser -- is that good enough?</p>

<p>also, the i/o API doesn't have any way to save packed files, or report
files as packed, or return them.  it would be useful to be able to
say:</p>

<ul>
  <li>isPacked?
  <li>Sample[] unpack()
  <li>pack(Sample[])
</ul>

</body>
