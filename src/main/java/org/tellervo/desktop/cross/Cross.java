/**
   Abstract class representing a crossdating algorithm, and its scores.

   WRITEME: documentation should be organized as:
   -- introduction/overview
   -- to use this class (run a crossdate, extract results)
   -- to write a new crossdate (subclasses)
   -- prefs i use (the other inputs)
   -- events i watch; events views should watch

   <p>The data array holds the crossdate scores; the range holds the
   range of end dates for the moving sample.  After construction, the
   run() method must be called; making this a great candidate for
   running in a thread (hint, hint).</p>

   <p>To run a crossdate... WRITEME</p>

   <p>Subclasses must implement... WRITEME</p>

   <h2>Left to do</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>rename to "Crossdate"
     <li>make highScores an iterator (getHighScores()) instead of a public list
         -- but i need random access for the table model!  what to do?
     <li>use Prefs instead of Integer.getInteger()
     <li>get rid of Cross(){} c'tor -- needs other work...
     <li>get rid of preamble()?
     <li>make run() threaded so it's faster on dual-processor systems?
     <li>isFinished() and the threading stuff needs cleaning up
     <li>compute all scores (overlap=1 and up), and only show requested ones;
         idea: 1 = remove all minimum-overlap code, 2 = add new-style overlap
	 -- "high scores" list computes all; sig scores list should
	    only display those with len>min
	 -- "all scores" table shows all; should only show with len>min
	 -- "histo" list shows all; should only show with len>min
	    (is this harder?  need to recompute histogram each time?)
	 -- overlap bug: in last crossdate score, moving has overlap=2!

     <li>instead of the old getMinimumOverlap() method, use
         Prefs.getPref("tellervo.cross.overlap"); default value is 15
   </ul>
