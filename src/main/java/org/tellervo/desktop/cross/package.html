<p>Views and data structures for crossdating samples.</p>



<h2>How to use in an application</h2>

<p>Sequence provides the client interface to crossdating.  Construct a
Sequence with any number of fixed and moving samples.  You can step
through the crosses with nextCross() and prevCross(), and get the
current cross with getCross().  (Unfortunately, Java Enumerations are
forward-only, which is why I had to write my own.)</p>

<p>The Cross you get will only be references: you must still run() it.
A Cross contains the scores in <code>data</code>, as a
<code>double[]</code>.  Significant scores are stored in
<code>highScores</code>, as indexes into the data array.  (The method
<code>yearOfIndex()</code> might help.)

<p>Grids and Tables are completely different, because they're not
typically interactive, but they are constructed roughly the same as
NxN and 1xN Sequences, respectively.</p>



<h2>How to add a new crossdating algorithm</h2>

<p>Look at <code>Cross.java</code>; that's the class you need to
extend.  The only two methods you need to define are
<code>getMinimumSignificant()</code>, which returns the minimum -- NO, THIS IS OBSOLETE!  DON'T DO IT! --
significant crossdate score for that algorithm, and
<code>compute(int,int)</code>, which computes the score at those
particular offsets.  Your constructor should accept two Sample
objects, and pass them to super().</p> -- NO, THERE SHOULD BE A FACTORY, NO CONSTRUCTOR SHOULD BE REQUIRED

<p>You may need to create a <code>preamble()</code> method, too; this
does any needed operations with the data that must be done before
individual scores are calculated.  For example, the T-Score preamble
creates a normalized copy of the data.</p> -- NO, PREAMBLE SHOULD BE A SPECIAL CASE OF RUN, NOT AN ABSTRACT METHOD

<p>If you want your crossdate to be in general use, add it to
<code>CrossdateKit</code>, so people can use it.  If it's so popular
that people will want to use it all the time, add it to the list of
defaults in <code>Sequence</code>.</p>
