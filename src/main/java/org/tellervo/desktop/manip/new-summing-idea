new summing idea:

-- the only difference between a "summed" and "cleaned" file is
   whether elements, count, etc., exist

-- usually, this is a distinction that belongs to the sum, not the
   user of the sum

-- so instead of having separate files for each type, simply add a
   field "cleaned?" to sums -- it can be as simple as a checkbox in
   the elements tab that looks like [x] Single tree (clean this sum)

-- the only time it makes a difference is with summing, anyway.

CHANGES that need to be made to support this:

-- add a checkbox to the bottom of the elements panel:
   [x] Single tree (clean this sum)

-- remove all references to "cleaned"; for example, file dialogs, and
   the "clean" menuitem

-- add a "CLEANED" flag to samples

-- load and save the CLEANED flag properly -- for formats which won't
   support it natively, ignore the weiserjahre info?

-- update the sample preview text, perhaps as "Summed (cleaned)"

-- add support in the browser, perhaps using the same mechanism as the
   preview (searching for "cleaned" works)

-- when creating a sum, jump to the elements tab immediately; default
   to cleaned=true iff all samples are from the same site?

-- in the elements tab, add a new choice next to the "Enabled"
   checkbox: "as Elements", "as Cleaned".  (or maybe change the
   "Enabled" checkbox to a 3-way popup?: "Disabled", "Enabled as
   Elements", "Enabled as Cleaned"?)

-- add a new flag to Element.java stating whether this element is to
   be added as a sum or a single sample.

-- when summing, add as a raw sample or summed sample depending on
   this flag in Element

-- add undo/redo support for both the new choice per-element, and for
   the single-tree checkbox

-- if a user opens a cleaned file, and the same file exists as summed,
   ask to do some sort of migration?
