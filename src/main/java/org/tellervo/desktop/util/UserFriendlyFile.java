/**
   Just like File, but toString() returns its name, not its path.

   <p>Many Swing (and other) components accept any Object, and use the
   result of toString() as the label.  This is inconvenient if you're using
   Files, but don't want to show the full pathname.  You'd have to write
   your own model for a combobox or list or table.  Instead, just use
   a UserFriendlyFile.  Using this, you can put Files into your Swing
   components directly.</p>
