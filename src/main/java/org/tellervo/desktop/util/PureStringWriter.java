/**
   A Writer for Strings like StringWriter, but using the
   <code>'\n'</code> character for newlines instead of the filesystem
   default, regardless of platform.

   <p>Useful for platforms where a newline on disk is different from a
   newline everywhere else (like Windows).  Suppose you want to print
   some data to a text area; if you use a normal StringWriter, it
   assumes you'll want to use the filesystem's newlines, so on Windows
   you'll get extra <code>'\r'</code> characters.</p>
