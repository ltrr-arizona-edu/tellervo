/**
   A smart string compare function.  Uses some voodoo to get around
   problems with sorting non-English letters without being
   locale-specific.

   <p>This method solves problems with how Java does both String
   comparison, and Collator-based (locale-specific) string
   comparisons:</p>

   <ul>
     <li>String comparison compares Unicode values, so letters like
     "&Ccedil;" get put after "Z", instead of between "C" and "D"
     where you would expect it.

     <li>The Collator class is used to work around this, but it's
     locale-specific.  For example, if the locale is set to "Turkish",
     "&Ccedil;" will be sorted between "C" and "D".  Unfortunately,
     this is useless if you're trying to sort Turkish names while
     running your program in America, or, worse, trying to sort names
     of different languages, like English and Turkish.
   </ul>

   <p>This sorting scheme ignores case, and sorts first by the letter
   <i>with all accents removed</i>, and then by Unicode value.  This
   puts "&Ccedil;" between "C" and "D", and also is
   locale-agnostic.</p>
