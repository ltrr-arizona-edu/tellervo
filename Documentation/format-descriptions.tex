\section{Description}

The Besan\c{c}on format is most commonly used in a number of French laboratories. The format allows for multiple series in the same file. Each series (or element block in Lambert's notation) is made up of a header line, optional metadata and a data block each of which are delimited by a line feed. 


The header line begins with a dot character, then one or more spaces, then an element name (without spaces) followed by a space and any number of ignored characters.

The metadata fields are space or line feed delimited. Each field is recorded using a key of three letters. The format allows for the full spelling out of the field if preferred, but it is the first three letters that are read by software so LON is the same as LONGEUR. Some fields are `unimodal' in that their presence is all that is required e.g. CAM means that cambium was observed. Other fields are `bimodal' which means they require a value to be associated with them. In this case the field key is followed by a space and then an integer or string value e.g. POS 1950. The accepted metadata fields are as follows:
    \begin{description}
          \item[LON] Number of data values
          \item[POS] The temporary first ring date given relatively to a group
          \item[ORI] The year for the first ring
          \item[TER] The year for the last ring. Should be the same as ORI + LON
          \item[MOE] Pith present
          \item[CAM] Cambium present
          \item[AUB] Number of the first sapwood ring 
    \end{description}   
All other information in the metadata block should be ignored. This feature is often used to allow the inclusion of multi-line comments. 

The data block begins with the marker line VAL (like metadata keys, subsequent characters are ignored so sometimes the rest of this line is used for comments). Subsequent lines contain integer values delimited by a space or line feed. Missing rings are marked with a comma character and the end of the data is marked with a semicolon. 


\section{Additional information}

\begin{itemize*}
  \item There is nothing in the specification to say what precision the data values should be in. Following conversations with users it appears that Besan\c{c}on files are mostly 1/100th mm but this is not always the case. Some files include a Pr√©cision field, but this is not documented or standardised.
  \item There are a number of additional fields that are commonly used but which do not appear in the format specification. These are also supported by the DendroFileIOLib
  \begin{description}
    \item[ESP] Species
    \item[ECO] Bark present  
  \end{description}

\section{Background}
The CATRAS format \citep{catras} is the only known binary dendro data format. As such it can't be read by a simple text editor, and can't be imported by spreadsheet or database programs. The format was designed by Roland Aniol for use in his program of the same name. The binary nature of the format means the files are typically much smaller than text files containing similar data. The closed nature of the format originally meant that users were tied to the application.  The fact that users can't manually edit the file means that the validity of files is not a problem like it is with most other dendro formats.

The format was originally decoded in the early 1990's and permission was granted by Aniol for a converter to be included in Henri Grissino-Mayer's CONVERT5 application. Subsequently others have independently released application and code that can read CATRAS files to a greater or lesser extent. 

Following its original release in 1983, CATRAS was updated several times, the most recent version (v4.42) was released in 2010. The code in DendroFileIOLib is based in part on Matlab, Fortran and C code of Ronald Visser, Henri Grissino-Mayer and Ian Tyers. 

\section{Reading byte code}

Reading byte code is more complicated than reading text files. Each byte is 8-bits and therefore can represent up to 256 values. Depending on the type of information each byte contains, the bytes are interpreted in one of four ways: 

\subsection{Strings} Some of the bytes in CATRAS files contain character information. In this case each byte represents a letter. In java an array of bytes can be directly decoded into a string. 

\subsection{Integers} As a byte can only represent 256 values, whenever an integer is required it is stored as a byte pair. Each byte pair consists of a least significant byte (LSB) and a most significant byte (MSB). The order that they appear in files typically varies between platforms and is known as 'endianness'. As CATRAS solely runs on Microsoft (x86) processors we can safely assume that all CATRAS files will be using little-endian (i.e. LSB MSB). The counting in a byte pair therefore works as follows: 

\begin{table*}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular*}{5cm}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}} r r r }
  \toprule
Value & LSB & MSB\\
\midrule
1 & 1 & 0\\
2 & 2 & 0\\
3 & 3 & 0\\
\dots & \dots & \dots\\
256 & 0 & 1\\
257 & 1 & 1\\
258 & 2 & 1\\
\dots & \dots & \dots\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\end{center}
\end{table*}

A byte pair can therefore store 256x256=65536 values (more than enough for most number fields). 

\subsection{Real numbers}

Statistical values--such as arithmetic mean, standard deviation, first-order autocorrelation, and mean sensitivity--are given for all the ring widths and optionally for the ring widths in a restricted part of the series. The real numbers are given in standard format defined by the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic.

\subsection{Categories}

Categories are typically recorded as single bytes as most categories have just a few possible values. They can therefore be conceptualized as being integers where 0=first option, 1=second option etc. The exception to this is for species because there are more than 256 species. In this case, a byte pair is used in exactly the same way as described for integers above. The only problem for species is that the codes are unique to each laboratory and refer to values enumerated in a separate '.wnm' file. Without this dictionary the species code is of little use. 

\subsection{Dates}
The date of the creation of the series and the date of the last amendment to the series are stored as three single bytes each, one for day, one for month, and one for year. The year is stored with an offset of 1900. Therefore numbers from 1 to 100 belong to the 20th century (calendar year 1901 to 2000) and numbers from 101 to 200 belong to the 21th century (calendar year 2001 to 2100). 

\section{Metadata}

The first 128 bytes contain the file header information and the remainder of the file contains the ring-width data and sample depth data (if series is a chronology). If a series is only partly suitable for further analysis then this indicated in bytes 49--52. The quality code at position 58 is an overall rating for the series. This helps to exclude poor series from analyses other than dating.

\section{Data}

The remaining bytes in the file contain the actual data values stored as integer byte pairs. All data are stored in multiples of 128 bytes. If the number of data bytes given in the header at position 45--46 is not a multiple of 128 the file is padded with extra bytes accordingly. Padded bytes should be ignored. 

\subsection{Ring widths}

Ring widths are stored in hundredths of a millimetre in the same order as the tree had been grown. When working with archaeological or geological wood it might occur that a particular ring is damaged and therefore its width cannot be determined precisely. To indicate that fact and to exclude this particular ring from further calculations its measured width is stored negative. In the CATRAS program a negative ring width will be taken into account neither in the calculation of tree curves and chronologies nor in the statistics or in comparisons with other series.

\subsection{Chronologies}

Chronology files are indicated at position 84 in the file header and contain additional data in respect to raw data files. After the block of ring width data three additional data blocks follow. Firstly the number of ring widths averaged at a particular position follows (the sample depth). Then the number of series with the same trend between subsequent ring widths at a particular position follows. Then the number of series with the opposite trend between subsequent ring widths at a particular position follows. All data blocks are stored in multiples of 128 bytes. If the number of data bytes given in the header at position 45-46 is not a multiple of 128 each block is padded with extra bytes accordingly. Padded bytes should be ignored.

\section{Description}

This is a binary format used primarily in Polish labs (e.g. AGH-UST in Cracow,
Universities in Szczecin, Torun and Katowice).  It is a simple data-only format with no support for calendars or dating.  There are two types of file (AVR and AVS) but the format for them is identical, the only difference being that the AVR extension indicates the file is a measurement series file and AVS extension indicates a chronology file.

The file begins with a six character header:

\begin{enumerate*}
 \item Zero
 \item Ring number where sapwood begins
 \item Zero
 \item Ring number where sapwood ends (also length of sample)
 \item Zero
 \item Zero
\end{enumerate*}

If there is no sapwood recorded, then bytes 2 and 4 will both be zero.  The zero bytes at positions 1, 3, 5 and 6 can be used as a signature to check the file is in Cracow format.

Following the six header bytes, there comes the ring width values.   Each ring value is stored in two bytes, the second containing the values from 0 to 99 and the first contains the values >100.  For instance the ring value 345 would be stored in two values, 3 and 45.

\section{Description}

Comma separated values format is a simple text format for representing tabular data. It is not specific to dendrochronology data and is supported by most spreadsheet and database applications. Data is delimited into columns using a comma character to indicate cell boundaries.

Support for CSV files in TRiCYCLE is limited to a particular layout of data.  The expected layout is the same as for Excel and ODF spreadsheet files:

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Row 1 - Header names for each column
 \item Column A - Year values
 \item Column B+ - One column for each series containing data values. Cells are left empty if no data is available for a series because it does not extend to a particular year. Data must be continuous for each series, so missing/unmeasured rings should be included as zero.
\end{itemize*}

\section{Description}

The Corina Legacy format is the file format used by the Corina software prior to version 2, when it transferred to using TRiDaS. The format was originally designed for use with the MS-DOS version of Corina but was also used as the native file format in the later Java versions (up to and including v1.1).

A Corina file contains yearly data (ring-width and number of samples for that year), some fixed metadata, and optionally weiserjahre data and a listing of element samples (for summed samples).

The title comes first, on a line by itself, followed by a blank line. The title is repeated later, so this is only to make it easier for people or external programs to read the title.

The \emph{metadata section} comes next. The syntax is \verb|;TAG| value. Tags are all uppercase. Their order is fixed. Some values are terminated by a newline, others by the next semicolon. Valid tags, and their internal names are: 

\begin{itemize*}
 \item ID - 8 character ID used when exporting to Tucson format
\item  NAME - Name of the series
\item  DATING - Either R (relative) or A (absolute)
\item  UNMEAS\_PRE - Number of unmeasured rings towards the pith
\item  UNMEAS\_POST - Number of unmeasured rings towards the bark
\item  FILENAME
\item  COMMENTS, COMMENTS2 etc - Free text comments
\item  TYPE - either C (core), H (charcoal) or S (section)
\item  SPECIES
\item  SAPWOOD - Count of sapwood rings
\item  PITH - either P (present), * (present but undateable), or N (absent)
\item  TERMINAL - either B (bark), W (waney edge), v (near edge), vv (unknown)
\item  CONTINUOUS - referring to the outer ring, either C (continuous), R (partially continuous) or N (not continuous)
\item  QUALITY - either + (one unmeasured ring), ++ (more than one unmeasured ring)
\item  FORMAT - either R (raw) or I (indexed)
\item  INDEX\_TYPE - type of index used
\item  RECONCILED - Y or N indicating whether the series has been reconciled against another series 
\end{itemize*}

The \emph{data section} comes next and this always starts with the line ;DATA and for reasons lost in time there are nine spaces afterwards.

Data lines come in pairs, the first line containing the year and data values, the second containing the sample depth/count for each value. For reasons unknown, the first and last data line pair have a slightly different syntax to the others. 

\begin{itemize*}
 \item First data line begins with a space and an integer for the first year in the line. There then follows 9 spaces followed by the integer data value for the first ring. The remaining data values (often less than a full decades worth) on that line follow as integers left padded by spaces to take up 6 characters.
\item  The sample depth line that pairs with this follows next starting with 16 spaces, followed by the sample depth value enclosed in square brackets. The remaining sample depth values follow in square brackets left padding with spaces to take up 6 characters.
\item  Next comes the first normal data line. This begins with a space, followed by an integer year value. The data values follow as integers left padded by spaces to take up 6 characters. A data line has a decades worth of data values.
\item  Next comes the normal sample depth line. It begins with 7 spaces followed by each of the sample depth values enclosed in square brackets and left padded with spaces up to 6 characters.
\item  Data lines continue in pairs until the last line is reached. This is the same as a normal data line except it includes an extra data value 9990 as a stop marker. This data line may have less than a full decade of values.
\item  The final sample depth line is the same as normal except it is shifted left by 4 characters. A sample depth value is also included for the dummy 9990 stop marker year. 
\end{itemize*}

Following the data block there is a blank line and two option blocks of data that are only included if the file is a chronology file.

The next block of information in a chronology file is denoted by a line ;ELEMENTS. The following lines contain the file names of the data files that have contributed to the creation of the chronology.

Following this is an optional block denoted by the line ;weiserjahre followed by the weiserjahre data. Each weiserjahre data line begins with a space followed by a integer year value for the first year in the line. The weiserjahre value is left padded with spaces to fill 6 characters and the value itself is written as X/Y where X is the number of samples that show an upward trend in width; and Y is the number of samples that show a downward trend in width. The weiserjahre value is forward facing so the value for ring 1001 shows the trend between ring 1001 and 1002. There is therefore one less weiserjahre value in the final row than there are ring-widths.

The final line of Corina data files contains the author's name preceded by a tilde.

\section{Description}

The DendroDB format is an export file format produced by the \href{http://dendrodb.cerege.fr/indexBAD.htm}{DendroDB website/database}. There is no known software that can natively read DendroDB files so a `writer' for this format has not been developed.

The format is self-explanatory, beginning with a copyright line, followed by 7 metadata lines, then the data itself. There are eight possible data variables: Total width; Earlywood width; Latewood width; Min. Density; Max. Density; Earlywood density; Latewood density; Average density. Ring width data is provided in microns but the units for density measurements are not document.

As of Feb 2011, the DendroDB database does not contain data prior to 441AD so handling of BC/AD transition has not been tested. The DendroDB web interface suggests that BC dates should be entered as negative integers, but it also allows request for data from year 0. This suggests the database uses an Astronomical calendar and this is how the DendroIOLib treats it.

\section{Description}

The Heidelberg format \citep{tsap} is the native file format for Rinntech's TSAP-Win software. It supports metadata in the form of keyword-value pairs. There are more than 140 standard keywords specified in the documentation, but users can extend these with their own. This makes the format extremely flexible, but the absence of any checking of data types (strings, numbers categories etc) and no method of validation means that there can be problems interpreting metadata entries.

Heidelberg files can store one or more series in a single file. Each series is represented by a header and a data block.

The header block begins with a line HEADER:. This is followed by lines of metadata, with one field on each line, in the format keywords=value much like a standard Windows INI file. As mentioned previously there are a number of predefined keywords, all of which are outlined here:

The meaning of many of these keywords is fairly self-explanatory but others are a little more obscure. As there is no data typing or validation the format of the contents of these fields cannot be predicted. This is particularly a problem when trying to compare fields such as Latitude, Longitude and FirstMeasurementDate, but is especially a problem when comparing files produced in different labs.

The header section is followed by a data section denoted by a line containing the keyword DATA: followed by the type of data present which can be one of Tree; HalfChrono; Chrono; Single; Double; Quad. Tree, HalfChrono and Chrono are the original keywords supported by early versions of TSAP but these are now deprecated in preferences of the more generic Single, Double and Quad terms. The terms Single, Double and Quad are largely interchangeable with Tree, HalfChrono and Chrono respectively, but not completely. Double can refer to both Tree and HalfChrono format data. When the newer terms are used, the header keyword DataFormat is used to record whether the data is equivalent to Tree, HalfChrono or Chrono.

\begin{description}
\item[Single format] - data is typically used for storing raw measurement series. Each data line contains 10 data values each being a left space padded integer taking up 6 characters. Any spare data values in the final data line are filled with zeros. Alternatively it appears that TSAP-Win also accepts this data section as single integer values one per line.

\item[Double format] - data is for storing data with sample depth information - typically chronologies. Like the single format section, data is stored as 10 integer values, each taking up 6 characters and left padded with spaces. The values are in pairs of ring-widths and sample depths, therefore five rings are stored per line.

\item[Quad format] - data is for storing chronologies with sample depth as well as data on how many of the constituent series increase and decrease. This format therefore requires four numbers for each data point: ring-width; sample depth; increasing series; decreasing series. Numbers are stored as integers, left space padded as before, but this time only using 5 characters not 6. Four data points are included on each line, therefore this means there are 16 numbers per row and each row is 80 characters long.

\section{Description}
The KINSYS-KS format was designed for use with the application of the same name at the Finnish Forest Research Institute -- Metla.  The format is for raw measurement series and contains both data and structured metadata.  The primary focus of the metadata fields included are for forestry sampling.

The format allows for multiple data series within a single file, with each series beginning with a 14 line header, followed by multiple data lines, and finishing with the line \verb|*** DATA END ***|.  

The first line of the header contains the date and time the file was created.  All subsequent header lines are numbered \#0, \#1, \#2 etc and contain one or more metadata fields delimited with a backslash as shown below:

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Measurement timestamp
 \item \#0 - Project code / Project name / Responsible person
 \item \#1 - Sampling date
 \item \#2 - Ycoord / Xcoord / Elevation 
 \item \#3 - Experiment / Period of measurement / Location
 \item \#4 - Plot / Subplot
 \item \#5 - Measurement series code / ID Code
 \item \#6 - Tree species code
 \item \#7 - Last measurement year / Subsample code
 \item \#8 - Incomplete growth / estimated age increase / Last ring type
 \item \#9 - Sampling azimuth / measurement direction / Sample height / Sample height code
 \item \#10 - User defined parameters
 \item \#11 - Number of tree rings in sample / Data type / Columns / Number of decimals
 \item \#12 - Number of tree rings measured
\end{itemize*}

The meanings and formats of these fields are as follows:

\begin{description*}
 \item[Measurement timestamp] - This is the date and time that the file was created.  It is in the format dd-mm-yy hh:mm:ss
 \item[Project code] - Administrative code for the project
 \item[Project name] - Administrative name for the project
 \item[Responsible person] - Person responsible for the project
 \item[Sampling date] - Date the sample was taken formated dd.mm.yy
 \item[Ycoord] - Y coordinate of the location of the site in Finnish KKJ Uniform Grid coordinates
 \item[Xcoord]- X coordinate of the location of the site in Finnish KKJ Uniform Grid coordinates
 \item[Elevation] - Elevation of the site in metres
 \item[Experiment] - 
 \item[Period of measurement] - 
 \item[Location] - Name of site
 \item[Plot] - Code number for the plot being sampled
 \item[Subplot] - Code number of the sub-plot being sampled
 \item[Measurement series code] - Code for the measurement series
 \item[ID Code] - 
 \item[Tree species code] - Species code using either the ITRDB or VMI Finnish National Forest Inventory schemes
 \item[Last measurement year] - Calendar year for the last measurement 
 \item[Subsample code] - Code for if the sample is broken into pieces - marked a,b,c etc.  `x' marks a problematic samples where there are difficulties in analysis
 \item[Incomplete growth] - If the last incomplete growth ring is measured that this is set to `1', otherwise it is `0'
 \item[Estimated age increase] - Estimate for the number of tree-rings between the birth of the tree and the pith at the sample height.  Taken from VMI correction tables produced on a site and regional basis
 \item[Last ring type] - If the last incomplete ring is earlywood then this is marked as '1', otherwise it is marked as `2'
 \item[Sampling azimuth] - Either a letter code for the radii measured, or an angle in degrees of the azimuth along the measurement radius
 \item[Measurement direction] - Pith-to-bark = 0, Bark-to-pith = 1
 \item[Sample height] - Height at which sample was taken
 \item[Height code] - 
 \item[User defined parameters] - Free-text information
 \item[Number of tree rings in sample] - Number of rings in sample including those not measured.  If all rings were measured then this is indicated with a full-stop
 \item[Data type] - Coded as: 90=ring-width, 91=height shoots, 92=volume growths, 93=earlywood, 94=latewood.  Defaults to 90=ring-width.
 \item[Column with] - Number of digits the data is stored in. Default=3.
 \item[Number of decimals] - Number of decimal places the values are stored in.  Default=2;
 \item[Number of tree rings measured] - Number of rings that have been measured.

\section{Description}
The Excel file format is a widely used format for storing spreadsheet data. It is a proprietary binary format created by Microsoft but suppported by many spreadsheet and statistical applications.  It is not to be confused with the Office Open XML format which was introduced by Microsoft with MS Office 2007 and typically has the file extension xlsx.

Although Excel files can contain multiple sheets in a workbook, only the first sheet is considered.  Like the CSV and ODF Spreadsheet formats, support for Excel files is limited to a particular layout or style of spreadsheet. The layout of the data sheet should be as follows:

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Row 1 - Header names for each column
 \item Column A - Year values
 \item Column B+ - One column for each series containing data values. Cells are left empty if no data is available for a series because it does not extend to a particular year. Data must be continuous for each series, so missing/unmeasured rings should be included as zero.
\end{itemize*}

\section{Description}
This is the new XML file format introduced by Microsoft with Excel 2007. Unlike the binary format used by the previous version of Excel, this format is an open standard. However, it should not be confused with the OpenDocument Format standard that was developed by the OASIS consortium.

The layout of the data sheet should be just as for the Excel 97/2000/XP format:

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Row 1 - Header names for each column
 \item Column A - Year values
 \item Column B+ - One column for each series containing data values. Cells are left empty if no data is available for a series because it does not extend to a particular year. Data must be continuous for each series, so missing/unmeasured rings should be included as zero.
\end{itemize*}

\section{Description}

The Nottingham format was designed by Cliff Litton. It is a simple text format with no support for metadata.

Line 1 contains a series name and an integer indicating how many data values there are in the file. Subsequent lines contain the data represented as 1/100th mm integers in twenty columns seemingly in either 4 characters or 3 characters + 1 space.

There is no known reference implementation for this format and few known examples of data so little is known about how it should handle unusual situations such as negative values, values >999 etc.

\section{Description}

The OpenDocument Format (ODF) spreadsheet format is an XML-based specification developed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) consortium.  It should not be confused with the similarly named Office Open XML format developed by Microsoft.  The ODF spreadsheet format is an open standard which can be read by most modern spreadsheet applications including MS Excel, OpenOffice.org and Google Docs.

Support for ODF spreadsheets in TRiCYCLE is necessarily limited to a particular layout of spreadsheet:

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Row 1 - Header names for each column
 \item Column A - Year values
 \item Column B+ - One column for each series containing data values. Cells are left empty if no data is available for a series because it does not extend to a particular year. Data must be continuous for each series, so missing/unmeasured rings should be included as zero.
\end{itemize*}

Please see the Excel section for a screenshot of how an ODF spreadsheet should look.

\section{Description}

The Oxford format seems to be only currently used in the Oxford Dendrochronology Laboratory. It was designed in the 1980s for use with a number of DOS based applications for the English Heritage Ancient Monuments Laboratory. It is still actively used by the Oxford Lab with these programs and a number of newer Windows applications.

The file is a text file format containing two header lines following by a block of data values and an optional block of count/sample depth values. Some files also contain a number of comment lines at the end of the file.

Line 1 contains the following fields: 

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Char 1 - Apostrophe
 \item Chars 2-8 - Series name
 \item Char 9-10 - spaces
 \item Char 11 - <
 \item Chars 12-15 - First year in sequence (when series is securely dated).  Year should be left padded with spaces if less than 4 characters.
 \item Char 16 - hyphen
 \item Chars 17-20 - Last year in sequence (when series is securely dated).  Year should be left padded with spaces if less than 4 characters.
 \item Char 21 - space
 \item Char 22+ - Description - typically name of site/building etc
 \item Final char - optional apostrophe 
\end{itemize*}

Line 2 contains:

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Integer number of years
 \item Comma
 \item Integer start year
\end{itemize*}


The start year on line 2 and the first year on line 1 will be the same for securely dated series. When the series is tentatively or relatively dated the first year (and/or) the last year on line 1 will be left blank. For undated series the start year is set to 1001.

The data lines follow the two header lines. These typically contain 10 data values per line, but there can be more (if rings have been added) or less e.g. last line. The values are in 1/100th mm integers and can only contain three digits (e.g. max 999 1/100th mm). Data values are space delimited. Some example files contain values that are left padded with zeros if the value is on 1 or 2 characters wide (e.g. '025' rather than ' 25').

Following the data values there should be an empty line followed by an optional sample count/depth block. The count block is formatted in largely the same way as the data values block. The values are stored in columns 2 characters (rather than 3 characters) wide. Like the data values, the count values are space delimited integers, typically (but not always) 10 per line.

The file is terminated with 0, 1 or 2 free-text comment lines. A number of Oxford data files have been seen that terminate with the ASCII control character referred to variably as 'SUB', 'SUBSTITUTE' or 'CTRL+Z' (represented in Unicode as character dec 26 - hex 1A). It is not clear whether this is necessary for any particular programs to function. 

\section{Limitations}

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Only holds whole ring-width data
 \item Does not cope with data values >999 1/100th mm
 \item Does not cope with chronologies of >99 samples
 \item Does not allow dates before 1AD
\end{itemize*}

The PAST4 format \citep{past} is the native file format for SCIEM's PAST4 software. It is a hybrid XML file, containing most metadata in structured XML but some metadata and all data as plain text. It is unique amongst dendro data formats in that it contains not only data and metadata but also settings information for the PAST4 software such as details on what colours to use in graphs, which series should be displayed on screen etc. The general structure of a P4P file is as follows:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item  Project header (required)
    \item  Settings (optional)
    \item  Groups (required, repeatable)
    \item  Records (required, repeatable) 
\end{itemize*}


The root XML tag for the file is \verb|<PAST_4_PROJECT_FILE>|. Inside this is the \verb|<PROJECT>| tag which contains the following attributes:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item  ActiveGroup - Zero based index specifying which group is active
    \item  EditDate - Date the file was last edited
    \item  Groups - Number of groups within this project
    \item  Locked - Either TRUE or FALSE indicating whether a password is required to open the file
    \item  Name - Name of the project
    \item  Password - Password used to lock the project
    \item  PersID - Abbreviation of the authors name
    \item  Records - Number of records in the project
    \item  Reference - Zero based index indicated which is the reference series (-1 if none selected)
    \item  Sample - Zero based index indicating which is the selected sample (-1 if none selected)
    \item  Version - Version number for this PAST4 format. At the time of writing only one version exists (400). 
\end{itemize*}

Of these fields only Name, Groups and Records are mandatory. The project tag can also contain a \verb|<![CDATA[| tag which allows the storing of a project description in plain text.

Next comes the \verb|<SETTINGS>| tag. This is one very large XML tag with many attributes controlling the what PAST4 should display the data. The contents of this tag are optional and are therefore irrelevant for the transfer of dendro data.

Next comes one or more \verb|<GROUPS>| tags. A group is an arbitrary collection of series, perhaps representing a number of measurements of a single object, or perhaps an administrative collection of series. Groups can be nested in a hierarchy, but rather than use the hierarchical nature of XML files, the format instead lists all groups side-by-side and maintains the relationships through the use of an 'owner' attribute containing the index of the parent group. This arrangement means than any changes to the hierarchy, or the deletion of a group requires all indices to be carefully updated to avoid corrupting the file. The group tag has the following attributes:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item  Name - Name of the group
    \item  Visible - Either TRUE or FALSE indicating whether the group should be shown in graphs
    \item  Fixed - Either TRUE or FALSE indicating whether the group can be moved
    \item  Locked - Either TRUE or FALSE. If locked the group can be used in the calculation of further mean values.
    \item  Changed - Internal TRUE or FALSE value for keeping track of changes
    \item  Expanded - TRUE or FALSE value indicating whether the group should be expanding in the project navigator window
    \item  UseColor - TRUE or FALSE value for is content should be displayed in color
    \item  HasMeanValue - TRUE or FALSE indicating if the group has a dynamic mean value
    \item  IsChrono - TRUE or FALSE indicating if the group mean is calculated with sample depth information
    \item  Checked - TRUE or FALSE indicating if the group is locked and checked
    \item  Selected - TRUE or FALSE indicated in the group is selected in the project navigation window
    \item  Color - 24bit integer indicating the RGB volor value for the group using Borland format
    \item  Quality - Integer value describing the quality of the group mean
    \item  MVKeycode - String code for the group. If empty the Name field is used
    \item  Owner - Integer pointing containing the index of the parent group if this group is in a hierarchy. If its a top level group it should be -1. 
\end{itemize*}

As with the project tag, the group tag can also contain a \verb|<![CDATA[| section for storing a plain text description of the group.

The final tag type in the file is the \verb|<RECORDS>| tag. These contain the actual data series and most of the metadata. Like group tags, records tags are placed side-by-side in the file and are placed into the group hierarchy by the use of the 'owner' attribute. In addition, the tag also has the following attributes:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item  Keycode - Name of the series
    \item  Length - Integer for the number of rings
    \item  Owner - Integer index to the group to which this record belongs
    \item  Chrono - TRUE or FALSE indicating whether this record has density information
    \item  Locked - TRUE or FALSE indicating in the record can be moved
    \item  Filter - TRUE or FALSE indicating if an indexing function is appled to the data
    \item  FilterIndex - Integer index for the filter used
    \item  FilterS1 - Parameter 1 for the filter
    \item  FilterS2 - Parameter 2 for the filter
    \item  FilterB1 - Additional filter parameter
    \item  FilterWeight - Additional filter parameter
    \item  Offset - Position of the first ring
    \item  Color - 24bit RGB color for record in Borland format
    \item  Checked - TRUE or FALSE indicating is the record is selected for use in the dynamic group mean
    \item  !VShift - Temporary integer value added to data value to shift vertically in graphs
    \item  IsMeanValue - TRUE or FALSE indicating if this is a dynamic mean value
    \item  Pith - TRUE or FALSE
    \item  SapWood - Integer storing the number of sapwood rings
    \item  Location - String location information
    \item  Waldkante - String description of presence of waney edge
    \item  FirstValidRing - Integer indicating which ring is the first valid ring. If >0 then some rings are discarded
    \item  LastValidRing - Integer indicating which ring is the last valid ring. If >0 then some rings are discarded
    \item  UseValidRingsOnly - TRUE or FALSE - internal use only
    \item  Quality - Integer indicating the quality of the record 
\end{itemize*}
The record tag then contains a \verb|<HEADER>| tag with a \verb|<![CDATA[| section which includes additional free-text header information. There are no requirements as to how information should be laid out in this field however many users seem to adopt the Heidelberg style of keyword=value.

Next comes the \verb|<DATA>| tag which is empty except another \verb|<![CDATA[| section. This is where the actual ring-width data is stored. Each data value is recorded on a separate line (using CR LR line breaks). Each line contains the following six tab delimited fields:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item  Ring width as a floating point number
    \item  Sample depth
    \item  Number of sample increasing
    \item  Latewood percentage as a floating point value 0-1 (0 if not known)
    \item  Duplicate/backup ring-width value to store the original ring-width value. If an index is applied the ring-width value in column 1 is altered.
    \item  Comment string about this particular ring 
\end{itemize*}

\section{Dating}

PAST4 contains an option for enabling/disabling the year 0 but it does not record within the data file whether the option was set when the file was created. By default the year 0 is disabled therefore the library treats PAST4 files as if they use the Gregorian calendar but it is possible that files were in fact created with the Astronomical calendar in mind.

\section{Description}

Sheffield format \citep{dendroforwin} is a dendro specific text file designed by Ian Tyers for his Dendro for Windows application. It is probably most widely used in the UK but is also used in continental Europe as well as New Zealand.

The format contains both data and some structured metadata with each field/value stored one per line. The order of fields is fixed so missing data must be indicated by the use of a question mark. The data present on each line is as follows:

\begin{enumerate*}
 \item Site name/sample number - Free form text not including \verb|,"()| up to 64 characters 
 \item Number of rings - Whole positive number 
 \item Date type - Single character; A = absolute date, R = relative date 
 \item Start date - Whole number (can be negative).  If absolute year then add 10000 to value so 1AD = 10001
 \item Raw data type \emph{or} Mean data type 
      \begin{itemize*}   
       \item Single character; R = annual raw ring-width data (NB earlier versions used some other codes here for species e.g. ABEFPSU these are all interpreted as equivalent to R) 
       \item Single character; W=timber mean with signatures, X=chron mean with signatures, T = timber mean, C = chron mean, M = un-weighted master sequence 
      \end{itemize*} 
 \item Raw sapwood number \emph{or} mean number of timbers/chronologies
      \begin{itemize*}   
       \item Whole positive number or 0 
       \item Whole positive number
      \end{itemize*} 
 \item Raw edges inf. \emph{or} Mean chronology type
      \begin{itemize*}   
       \item Single character; Y = has bark, ! = has ?bark, W = terminal ring probably complete (i.e. possibly Winter Felled), S = terminal ring probably incomplete (i.e. possibly Summer Felled), B = has h/s boundary, ? = has ?h/s boundary, N = has no specific edge, (NB but may have sap), U = sap/bark unknown, C = charred outer edge, P = possibly charred outer edge 
       \item Single character; R = raw unfiltered data, 5 = 5 year running mean, I = indexed data, U = unknown mean type 
      \end{itemize*} 
 \item Author and comment - Free form text not including \verb|,"()| up to 64 characters 
 \item UK National grid reference - 2 characters +even no of digits up to 14 characters in all, ? = not known e.g. TQ67848675
 \item Latitude and longitude - Either decimal format e.g. 53.382457;-1.513623 or previously N51\verb|^|30 W1\verb|^|20
 \item Pith - single character; C = centre of tree, V = within 5 years of centre, F = 5-10 years of centre, G = greater than 10, ? = unknown
 \item Cross-section code - Two character code; first character, A = whole roundwood, B = half round, C quartered, D radial/split plank, E tangential/sawn plank. second character, 1 untrimmed, 2 trimmed, X irregularly trimmed. or, X = core /unclassifiable, ? unknown/unrecorded 
 \item Major dimension - whole number in mm, 0 if unrecorded or mean
 \item Minor dimension - whole number in mm, 0 if unrecorded or mean
 \item Unmeasured inner rings - single character+whole number; use pith codes + number of rings or, H = heartwood, N = none 
 \item Unmeasured outer rings - single character+whole number; use edges code + number of rings except that S = sapwood with no edge and V is the spring felling equivalent other codes are, H = heartwood with no edge, N = none
 \item Group/Phase - free form text not including , " ( ) up to 14 characters 
 \item Short title - free form text not including , " ( ) up to 8 characters 
 \item Period - single character; C = modern, P = post medieval, M = medieval, S = Saxon, R = Roman, A = pre Roman, 2 = duplicate e.g. repeat measure, B = multiperiod e.g. long master, ? = unknown 
 \item ITRDB species code - 4 character code - refer to ITRDB species codes 
 \item Interpretation and anatomical notes - ? =no interpretation/notes. The interpretation and the anatomical notes can be in any order but each must consist of three parts, a single character A or I for anatomy or interpretation, a separator ~, for interpretations the date of the start, for anatomy the ringno, a separator ~, for anatomy the anatomical code for interpretations P for plus, 0 for felled and a number for the length of the range, where more than one record is present these are separated by ~, there must not be a terminal separator and each record must consist of the tree parts. The anatomical codings can be anything of a single character but supported usage is based on Hans-Hubert Leuschners anatomical codes; D = Density Band, R = Reaction Wood, L = Light Latewood, H = Dense Latewood, F = Frost Ring, K = Small Earlywood Vessels - oak, G = Great Latewood Vessels - oak, T = Wound Tissue, N = Narrow Latewood, A = Light Latewood End, P = Narrow and Light Latewood, Q = Narrow and Dense Latewood 
 \item Data type - single character; D = ring widths, E = early-wood widths only, L = late-wood widths only, R = late+early wood widths (i.e. reverse of normal rings), I = minimum density, A = maximum density, S = early, late; (i.e. sequentially and separately), M = mixed (?means of others)

\end{enumerate*}

The remaining lines contain the data:

\begin{itemize*}
 \item For each width (equivalent to the value of length) the individual increments etc. if a C X T or W type mean.  No negatives or zeros
 \item Check field - Single character H
 \item For each width the individual weightings of the mean sequences. If an X or W type mean.  No negatives or zeros.
 \item Check field - Single character R
 \item For each width the number of individual series with rising values.  No negatives or zeros.
 \item Check field - Single character F
 \item For each width the number of individual series with falling values. No negatives.
\end{itemize*}

\section{Dating}

The format copes with the problem of the non-existent year 0AD/BC by adding 10000 to all year values. Therefore: 

\begin{table*}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular*}{5cm}{l @{\extracolsep{\fill}} l}
\toprule

\section{Description}

The Topham format is probably the most simplistic of formats consisting of just a column of decimal data values and no metadata whatsoever. Each data value is a decimal ring width in millimetres.

\section{Description}

TRiDaS (Tree-Ring Data Standard see \url{http://www.tridas.org}) is a data format designed by over 80 dendrochronologists, computer scientists and users of dendrochronological data from a variety of associated fields as part of the DCCD project and the Dendro Data Standard forum. It is designed to accurately represent any dendro data and metadata and it is hoped over time the dendro community will accept TRiDaS as the de facto standard for all dendro data.

The format uses extensible markup language (XML) which means the standard can be extended and evolve as future needs change. The format is structured around the eight data entities described below: 

\begin{description*}

\item[A project] is defined by a laboratory and encompasses dendrochronological research of a particular object or group of objects. Examples include: the dating of a building; the research of forest dynamics in a stand of living trees; the dating of all Rembrandt paintings in a museum. What is considered a ‚Äúproject‚Äù is up to the laboratory performing the research. It could be the dating of a group of objects, but the laboratory can also decide to define a separate project for each object. Therefore, a project can have one or more objects associated with it.

\item[An object] is the item to be investigated. Examples include: violin; excavation site; painting on a wooden panel; water well; church; carving; ship; forest. An object could also be more specific, for example: mast of a ship; roof of a church. Depending on the object type various descriptions are made possible. An object can have one or more elements and can also refer to another (sub) object. For instance a single file may contain three objects: an archaeological site object, within which there is a building object, within which there is a beam object. The list of possible object types is extensible and is thus flexible enough to incorporate the diversity of data required by the dendro community. Only information that is essential for dendrochronological research is recorded here. Other related data may be provided in the form of a link to an external database such as a museum catalogue.

\item[An element] is a piece of wood originating from a single tree. Examples include: one plank of a water well; a single wooden panel in a painting; the left-hand back plate of a violin; one beam in a roof; a tree trunk preserved in the soil; a living tree. The element is a specific part of exactly one object or sub object. An object will often consist of more than one element, e.g., when dealing with the staves (elements) of a barrel (object). One or more samples can be taken from an element and an element may be dated using one or more derivedSeries.

\item[A sample] is a physical specimen or non-physical representation of an element. Examples include: core from a living tree; core from a rafter in a church roof; piece of charcoal from an archaeological trench; slice from a pile used in a pile foundation; wax imprint of the outer end of a plank; photo of a back plate of a string instrument. Note that a sample always exists and that it can either be physical (e.g. a core) or representative (e.g. a picture). A sample is taken from exactly one element and can be represented by one or more radii.

\item[A radius] is a line from pith to bark along which the measurements are taken. A radius is derived from exactly one sample. It can be measured more than once resulting in multiple measurementSeries.

\item[A measurementSeries] is a series of direct, raw measurements along a radius. A single measurementSeries can be standardised or a collection of measurementSeries can be combined into a derived- Series. The measurements themselves are stored separately as values.

\item[A derivedSeries] is a calculated series of values and is a minor modification of the ‚Äúv-series‚Äù concept proposed by \citet{corina}. Examples include: index; average of a collection of measurementSeries such as a chronology. A derivedSeries is derived from one or more measurementSeries and has multiple values associated with it.

\item[A value] is the result of a single ring measurement. Examples include: total ring width; earlywood width; latewood width. The values are related to a measurementSeries or a derivedSeries. In case of a measurementSeries the variable and its measurement unit (e.g. microns, 1/100th mm etc) are recorded as well. 
\end{description*}

        <description>Our key long-range goal is to build long multi-millennial scale tree-ring
            chronologies in the Aegean and Near East that will extend from the present to the 
	    early Holocene to cover, broadly speaking, the last 10,000 years of human and 
	    environmental history. Our raison d'etre is to provide a dating method for the study
	    of history and prehistory in the Aegean that is accurate to the year. This kind of 
	    precision has, up to now, been lacking in ancient studies of this area. Indeed, few 
	    archaeological problems stimulate as much rancor as chronology, especially that of 
	    the Eastern Mediterranean. The work of the Aegean and Near Eastern Dendrochronology 
	    Project aims to help to bring some kind of rational and neutral order to Aegean and 
	    Near Eastern chronology from the Neolithic to the present. </description>

\section{Description}
The Tucson format is perhaps the most widely used dendro data format. Unfortunately it seems there was never definitive documentation. Support for the format has been incorporated into a number of dendro applications but without format documentation there are variations in these implementations resulting in quite a lot of subtle differences in files. The often tight association between the Dendro Program Library (DPL) and the ITRDB means that perhaps the most definitive documentation for the format is the ITRDB website.

The Tucson format is best considered as covering two different sub-formats which are often referred to by their file extensions (RWL and CRN). RWL files are used for storing ring-width data, whereas CRN files are used for storing chronologies.

The ITRDB website includes detailed information on how to include structured metadata in Tucson format files. Unfortunately there are no tools for creating and/or validating Tucson files so the vast majority of files circulating in the community today (including those in the ITRDB) do not adhere to these standards. 

\section{RWL files}
Tucson RWL files begin with three lines of metadata. Strictly these lines should contain structured metadata, but with no software to assist in this, users either only partially stick to these rules, or reject them entirely instead using the three lines as free-text comment lines. The metadata should be set out as follows:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item  Line 1 - Chars 1-6 Site ID
    \item  Line 1 - Chars 10-61 Site Name
    \item  Line 1 - Chars 62-65 Species Code followed by optional ID number
    \item  Line 2 - Chars 1-6 Site ID
    \item  Line 2 - Chars 10-22 State/Country
    \item  Line 2 - Chars 23-30 Species
    \item  Line 2 - Chars 41-45 Elevation
    \item  Line 2 - Chars 48-57 Lat-Long in degrees and minutes, ddmm or dddmm
    \item  Line 2 - Chars 68-76 1st and last Year
    \item  Line 3 - Chars 1-6 Site ID
    \item  Line 3 - Chars 10-72 Lead Investigator
    \item  Line 3 - Chars 73-80 comp. date 
\end{itemize*}

Then follows the data lines which are set out as follows:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item  Chars 1-8 - Series ID - the series ID should be unique in the file so that it is clear where one series ends and another begins when multiple series are present in the same file.
    \item  Next 4 chars - Year of first value in this row.
    \item  Ten data values consisting of a space character and 5 integers. The file and last data line for a series may have less than 10 data values so that the majority of lines begin at the start of a decade.  
\end{itemize*}

The final data value should be followed by a a stop marker which is either 999 or -9999. When a stop marker of 999 is used this indicates that the integer values in the file are measured in 0.01mm (1/100th mm) units, whereas if a -9999 stop marker is used the units are 0.001mm (microns). The stop marker is therefore used to indicate the end of the data series and the units the data are stored in.

There appears to be no official specification as to how missing rings should be encoded, but the standard notation seems to be to use -999 or 0. 

\section{CRN files}

Tucson CRN files are used to store chronology data. In addition to each data values they also have space for a sample depth or count value to record how many values were combined to give each data value. CRN files should strictly begin with the same 3 header lines that are described above for RWL. Like RWL files the specification is often partially adhered to and at times ignored completely.

The data lines for CRN files are quite different to RWL:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item  Chars 1-6 - Series ID
    \item  Next 4 chars - Year of first value in this row.
    \item  Ten data value blocks consisting of four integer characters for the data value, then a space, then two integer characters for sample depth. 
\end{itemize*}

The stop marker in a CRN file should be 9990. 

\section{Workarounds and quirks}

\begin{itemize*}
\item  No information was given as to how to handle the non-existent year 0AD/BC. For data files with years all in the AD period, this is not a problem. Most dendro software seem to treat year numbers in Tucson files as using the 'Astronomical Calendar' whereby 1 = 1AD, 0=1BC, -1=2BC etc. This goes against what most dendrochronologists assume (and do) when using Tucson files. For instance most people that work entirely in the BC period use negative integers to represent BC years e.g. -5 as 5BC. With no clear specification and different people interpreting the format in different ways, there is no way of being certain what data negative year numbers in Tucson files mean.
\item Tucson format places a restriction of just four characters to the year values. This means that strictly the earliest value a Tucson file can represent is -999. Some users work around this by steeling the last character of the series ID to give them five characters for the year. For example: ABCDEFG-9999. This conversely limits the series ID to 7 characters. To add to the confusion, other users have been known to add an arbitrary number (e.g. 5000) to all year numbers to overcome this problem.
\item  The fact that 999 is used as the stop marker for series in 1/100th mm means that Tucson files cannot store a ring value of 9.99mm. In the unlikely event that a sample should have this large a ring, it should be rounded up or down to 998 or 1000.
\item  Some programs appears to add padding values after the stop marker to fill the rest of the 10 data values in the row.
\item  Some data files seem to use 9990 as a stop marker
\item  Some files appears to use a full-stop character to indicate empty data values after the stop marker.
\item  Data values in RWL files are space delimited, however some programs use tabs instead.
\item  When reading Tucson files, COFECHA and ARSTAN ignore all lines that do not match the standard data line format. As such, some users have used this to enable them to include multiple comment lines in their files.
\item  The ITRDB documentation says they should be recorded as DDMM or DDDMM, but this along with sign (N,S,E,W,+ or -) would require 11 characters, when the Tucson specification only allows for 10. Perhaps this was due to an assumption that all places would be in the northern hemisphere? This has resulted in a large amount of variation in the way that coordinates are recorded making it extremely difficult to parse them without error. Here are some examples (including some that use 11 chars not 10):

\section{Description}


The Tucson Compact format was design by Richard Holmes for use with a number of the applications in the Dendro Program Library (DPL). Holmes designed it as a space saving alternative to the standard Tucson format at a time when disk space was expensive. The format never really caught on, perhaps due to the complexity and variability of the format.

The key feature of Tucson Compact format is the inclusion of a code that describes the layout of the data within the series. This code means that only the required amount of space is allocated to each data value in the text file with little wastage. No space is provided for metadata.

Tucson Compact files can contain one or more series of data so the description of a data series below can be repeated multiple times in a single file. All lines should be 80 characters long and the first line of a series is denoted by a tilde (~) in the final column. This meta line contains four fields:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item  Chars 0-9 = number of data values terminated with =N
    \item  Chars 11-19 = start year terminated with =I
    \item  Chars 21-68 = series title
    \item  Chars 69-79 = fortran format descriptor
    \item  Char 80 = Tilde marker 
\end{itemize*}

The Fortran format descriptor in the example below is -2(26F3.0). The constituent parts are as follows:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item  -2 = this is the scaling factor for the data values. In this case -2 = 10-2 = 0.01. Please note that in the Convert5 program this scaling factor is only read once in the first header line so files with multiple series each with different scaling factors will read incorrectly. 
    \item  26F = means there are 26 values in each line
    \item  3.0 = means that each data value should be read as 3 integer values 
\end{itemize*}

The example below therefore means there are 26 data values per line each consisting of 3 digits which should be interpreted by multiplying by 0.01 (i.e. values are in 1/10ths mm).

\section{Description}
A relatively extensive format which includes highly encoded header lines for metadata. VFormat files have an array of file extensions depending on the type of data the files contain.

VFormat files can contain mutliple data series. Each series contains 2-4 header lines followed by a number of data lines. The metadata fields are encoded into the header lines in specific character positions. In line 1 the character positions are as follows: 

\begin{itemize*}
 \item 1-12 = Series identifier. The series identifier also determines the filename. If there is just one series in the file then the series identifier will be the same as the filename. For files with multiple series, the filename will use characters 1-7 of the series identifiers that are the same throughout the file with the remaining (different) characters replaced by an underscore. The 8th character of the filename would contain a running number for files that would otherwise be named the same. The series identifier is made up of the following characters: 
  \begin{itemize*}
  \item 1 = Code representing the project or country
  \item  2 = Code representing the region of ecological area
  \item  3-4 = Code number for sample site (optionally encoded using hexadecimal or hexatresimal to enable values greater than 99).
  \item  5-6 = Series/tree number (optionally encoded using hexadecimal or hexatresimal to enable values greater than 99).
  \item  7 = Height code encoded as follows: 1 = 1m, 2=2m, 9=9m, A=10m, B=11m, S = Lumber height 30cm, T = breast height =130cm.
  \item  8 = Running number if several series have the same values in columns 1-7.
  \item  9 = Fixed as a dot character
  \item  10 = Either ! (single), \% (partial), \# (mean curves or chronologies)
  \item  11 = Code for statistical treatment. One of F (frequency filtered series); I (index); M (mean); O (original); P (pointer-year stat); Q (cluster-pointer-year stat); R (residual); S (moving deviation or variance); T (trend, fitted curve, model); W (wuchswert); X (series with standardized running mean and variance); Z (central moment, deviation or variance between several series).
  \item  12 = Code for the measured parameter. One of D (mean density); F (earlywood width); G (maximum density); J (ring width); K (minimum density); P (percentage latewood); S (width of latewood). 
  \end{itemize*}
\item  13-15 Measurement units
\item  16-20 Length of series
\item  21-24 Species either encoded using ITRDB taxon codes or by using the first two letters of the genus and species.
\item  25-30 Year of the last ring
\item  31-50 Description
\item  51-58 Measurement date (ddMMyy or ddMMyyyy)
\item  59-60 Initials of author
\item  61-68 Last modified date (ddMMyy or ddMMyyyy)
\item  69-70 VFormat version identifier (00,01 etc)
\item  71-73 Estimated number of missing rings as the start of the series
\item  74-75 Standard error of this estimate (. if unknown)
\item  76-78 Estimated number of missing rings at the end of the series
\item  79-80 Standard error of this estimate (. if unknown) 
\end{itemize*}

The second data line is a free text comment up to 80 characters.

VFormat files from version 10 onwards then contain a third header line. This contains 8 floating point numbers of 10 digits each. These represent: 
\begin{itemize*}
 \item Longitude
 \item  Latitude
 \item  Altitude
 \item  Height of the tree's measurement
 \item  Four other user definable numbers 
\end{itemize*}

VFormat files from version 20 onwards contain a forth header line. This is of the same format as line 3 but each of the values is user definable.

Following the 2-4 header lines come the data lines. These lines are made up of 10 data fields each containing 8 characters. Each data field is made up as follows: 

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Two character code for validity and importance:
  \begin{itemize*}
  \item space = full validity
  \item ! = not yet used
  \item " = not yet used
  \item \# = not yet used
  \item \$ = no validity for long-term evaluations
  \item \% = no validity for single-value evaluations
  \item \& = no validity except for cumulative stats
  \item ' = no validity at all, unknown value 
  \end{itemize*}
\end{itemize*}

The second character is a pseudo-binary character used to define a weighting factor.  For full details of the complex method for calculating this weighting factor see the VFormat documentation.

\begin{itemize*}
 \item One character user definable code for recording information about the data value 
 \item Five digit floating point data value which is divided by 100 for interpretation 
\end{itemize*}

\section{Description}

WinDENDRO format is a dendro text file format designed by Regent Instruments for their WinDENDRO software. Regent Instruments claims the format is proprietary. Although it is unclear whether such a claim is legally binding for a plain text file, the authors of DendroFileIOLib have decided to comply by not implementing a WinDENDRO format writer. However, in the interests of the dendro community and to ensure users can gain access to their data, DendroFileIOLib does include support for reading WinDENDRO format files.

WinDENDRO files differ from most other formats in that they contain a great deal of information specific to the image used to measure the sample. The WinDENDRO software allows users to measure ring widths from scans or photographs of samples rather than by using a traditional measuring platform.

WinDENDRO files are really just tab-delimited text files with data in columns in a specific order with a few additional header lines.

Line 1 should contain 8 tab-delimited fields 

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Field 1 = WINDENDRO
 \item  Field 2 = WinDENDRO file format version number, either 3 or 4
 \item  Field 3 = Orientation of the data: R = in rows; C = in columns. All WinDENDRO files are in rows
 \item  Field 4 = The column number where the data values begin. For version 3 files this is 13 and version 4 files this is 36
 \item  Field 5 = The direction the data is recording in: P = pith to bark; B = bark to pith
 \item  Field 6 = Whether the data is recorded incrementally (I) or cumulatively (C). WinDENDRO files are always incremental.
 \item  Field 7 = Whether the bark width has been measured (Y or N). If yes, then there will be one more data value than there are rings
 \item  Field 8 = RING 
\end{itemize*}

Line 2 contains the field names.  For version 3 files these are:

\begin{itemize*}
 \item TreeName - The name of the tree being measured
 \item Path identification - ID of the path along which the series is measured
 \item Site identification - Name of the site from which the tree was taken
 \item YearLastRing - Year of the last ring in the series
 \item Sapwood - Distance (in mm) from the start of the sample to the start of the sapwood.
 \item Tree height - Height of tree in metres
 \item Tree age - Age of the tree. If unknown this should be 0, then it is assumed to be equal to the number of rings
 \item SectionHeight - Height up the tree in metres at which the sample was taken
 \item User variable - User defined variable - must be numerical
 \item RingCount - Number of rings the series contains
 \item DataType - Keyword indicating the type of data measured. This can be: RINGWIDTH; EARLYWIDTH; LATEWIDTH; EARLYWIDTH\%; LATEWIDTH\%; DENSITY; EARLYDENSITY; LATEDENSITY; MAXDENSITY; MINDENSITY; RINGANGLE.
 \item OffsetToNext - The number of lines to skip to go to the next data line of the same type. For instance a file can contain earlywood and latewood data for multiple samples. If this is the case then each sample will have two rows, one for each variable, and the OffsetToNext field will be 1. 
\end{itemize*}

In additional to these fields, version 4 files also include the following: 

\begin{itemize*}
 \item ImageName - The filename for the image used to do this analysis. If the image was taken directly from the scanner or camera then this field will be SCANNER
\item 

Analysis Date Time - Date and time the measurements were initially saved to disk in format dd/mm/YYYY HH:mm
\item 

Acquisition Date Time - Date and time the image file was acquired in format dd/mm/YYYY HH:mm
\item 

Modified Date Time - Date and time the file was last modified in format dd/mm/YYYY HH:mm
\item 

ImageSize H V NBits Channel - The image size in pixels followed by bits per pixel per channel (8 or 16), channel used for analysis (Grey, RGB, R G or B )
\item 

CalibMethod XCal YCal EditedDendro - Method of calibration: Intr (Intrinsic); Obj (ObjKnownDiam). This is followed by the size of a pixel and Y or N indicating if the image has been edited in WinDENDRO
\item 

ScannerCamera Make Model Software - Details about the imaging hardware
\item 

LensFocLength [35mm] - The 35mm equivalent focal length of the imaging lens
\item 

PathBegX BegY EndX EndY Width - The coordinates for the start of the path/radius followed by the path width
\item 

RingBoundary AutoMan Meth Precise - Details about the path taken. Ring boundary - Tg (tangent to ring) or Perp (perpendicular to path); Detection method - A (automatic) or M (manual); Ring detection method - Int (intensity differences) or T\&S (teach and show); whether the 'more precise detection' method is active (Y) or not (N)
\item 

EarlywoodDef - Earlywood-latewood transition criteria
\item 

DensActive Media Calib - Density Analysis active (Y or N); Density Media setting (F - negative file or photo, W wood direct xray, positive film or photo); Light calibration setting (Acq - after image acquisition, Man - manual; No - none)
\item 

DensNSteps MatDens Interpol - Number of steps and the density of the step wedge used for calibration followed by the interpolation method used between steps: Lin (Linear) Spl (Spline)
\item 

DensStepsThick - The thickness of each step of the wedge used for density calibration
\item 

DensStepsLightInt - The light intensity of each step of the wedge determined during the light intensity calibration
\item 

DensStepsWoodDens - Equivalent wood density of each step of the wedge determined during light intensity calibration
\item 

DiskArea - Area of the sample
\item 

DiskPerim - Perimeter of the sample
\item 

DiskAvgDiam - Average diameter of the sample
\item 

DiskFormCoef - Sample area form coefficient
\item 

CompWoodArea - Total area occupied by the compression areas
\item 

VoidArea - Total area occupied by the void areas
\item 

PathLength - Length of radius measured 
\end{itemize*}

Lines 3+ contain the actual data and metadata, one line for each series. Following the 13 or 36 columns of metadata (depending on file version) there are $x$ number of columns containing ring values. The values are recorded as floating point data. The units for these data values are: mm for widths; \% for percentages; g/cm$^3$ for densities; radians for angles.
