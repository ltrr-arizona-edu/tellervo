DocBook for Dummies, or, what I learned about DocBook (the hard way) for Corina (--include java in title?)

(1) why
-- why to use docbook
   -- it's an open standard, it's open-source, lots of people already use it
   -- plain text!
-- what i hope to achieve
-- why i wrote this document: on getting a docbook system set up: "currently I feel like
playing a text-adventure, getting different types of hints from different persons."

(2) what's docbook?

Ok, here we go.  DocBook* is an open standard for how to describe a
document.  You know how Microsoft Word reads ".doc" files and Adobe
Acrobat reads ".pdf" files?  DocBook is another format for files.  But
it's open, unlike Word, and it's simple enough you can write it
yourself, unlike PDF.  Plus, it's plain text, so you can use all
your old text processing tools (sed, grep, wc), and it's XML, so
you can use any XML processing tools you find (**like what?).

So if you want to publish a document with DocBook, you can just open
a text file in your editor and start typing:

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <!DOCTYPE ???>
  <book>
    <para>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.</para>
  </book>

That's not so tough.  That's DocBook.  Text goes in between <para> </para>,
which mark the start and end of a paragraph.  There are a bunch of other
"tags" like this you can use to emphasis text, make lists or tables,
build a table of contents, or include graphics in your text.  There's a big
list here (URL???).  You don't have to memorize them.  Just go look it up.

But that text file you typed isn't very useful to people who want to
read your book.  They'll want to read it in their web browser, for
example.  Or maybe they'll want to print it out.

What you need are some DocBook tools. -- hmm, i'll need xml here... -- no, not really



* Actually "DocBook-XML", since there's an older version based on SGML
  instead of XML, but that version is dying.  And only some computer
  geeks care that it's based on XML.  I mean, when you're writing an
  HTML file to put on your web page, do you care that HTML is based on
  SGML?  Nah.  Just be aware that it's technically "DocBook-XML" if you
  plan to search old Usenet postings, because originally it wasn't XML.

====

the executive summary
-- docbook is just a standard -- xml and sgml, though sgml is dying
-- xslt is a way to convert xml to something else
   -- saxon is a java xslt processor.  xsltproc is another (but not java).  (xalan is, but probably not as good.)
      -- note, saxon still needs a sax parser (what's sax?); i use crimson
-- everybody uses norm walsh's xslt stylesheets
-- they can generate html (chunked and not), javahelp, and "fo"
-- you can make "fo" into pdf with apache's fop
-- (i could also use passivetex to use TeX to make a pdf, but it's not java)

(3) getting things working
-- start converting
-- getting it to work at all (xmlto)

(4) getting things working smoothly
-- integrating with ant
   -- need java versions of everything
      -- saxon (docbook->html, docbook->javahelp, docbook->fo), fop (fo->pdf)
   -- download saxon
      -- tried saxon 7.1 (newest one that works with java 1.3)
      -- strange error message; apparently that's code for "you need to downgrade to saxon 6.5.2"
   -- download fop
      -- strange error messages
      -- apparently it's something wrong with my <qandaset>
   -- making chunked html
-- validation
